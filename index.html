  <div id="paragrapha">
    <p id="Pinfo" width=75%>Throughout the history of humankind, deforestation has been an occurring
       theme for human advancement. Deforestation is the process of removing trees,
        whether for agriculture expansion, wood extractions, or infrastructure
         expansion purposes. The introduction of paper, along with an increased 
         need for agricultural and industrial expansions, further contributed to the 
         increased rate of deforestation.The millions of trees that have been 
         removed to satisfy the demand has consequently produced world hazards. 
          For example, there has been an increased risk of forest fires which would
          create a high amount of carbon dioxide
          in the atmosphere. </p>

<h2 class="StatsSub">Analyzing Presents Levels</h2>
<p id="Paragraph1">
  Deforestation continues to plague the Earth, and itâ€™s now how
   much we can still save. Internationally, we continue to decline 
   in forest area, and currently, in 2022 we are at the lowest point.
    To keep this in perspective, we have lost ~0.01% of our total forest area.
     Although this may not seem like much, we have lost ~196156814 hectares of 
     forest area since 1990. General T-Tests show that every country has a unique data set of forest areas.
 This establishes the point that not any one country is causing deforestation,
  instead a specific group of countries. To confirm this, first, the F-test was used to 
  confirm a significant difference between the tested groups. Next, a one-way ANOVA test
   was used to determine significant differences. Finally, a post-hoc Tukey HSD test was 
   used to determine if these differences were due to error. The ANOVA test revealed that
    the size of a country heavily affects the rate of deforestation. The post-hoc Tukey HSD
     test rejected the null hypothesis that these results were due to error. So although
      larger countries such as the US experience more hectares of forest area lost, Honduras,
       Nigeria, and the Philippines have experienced the most deforestation in regards to the 
       percentage decline of forest area. Not surprisingly, they also all have the largest percent 
       variation in forest area since 1990. That said, larger countries such as the US, China,
        and Australia contribute the most to lost hectares of forest area since 1990, due to
         their originally large forest area. T-Tests between smaller countries revealed that
          not only the percent rate of deforestation is very similar, but also the hectares of
           forest area lost. The smallest countries themselves cannot contribute much to global
            deforestation, as the ANOVA tests show as well. All tests used a p-value significance 
            level of 0.05 (5%). 95% confidence rate with T-Tests also used to prevent type 1 T-Test error
             (false negative).

  <p id="Paragraph2">
    The scatter plot, Predictions 2030, depicts future levels of global hectares of forest area vs. year.
  The r^2 value is higher since predictions fit the regression model perfectly. The trend of the subtle decline of the global forest
    area year by year is still presents 10 years into the future. By 2030, the global amount of forestry in the world reaches just below 4,000,000,000 hectares.
